This project demonstrates analysis of sales data and customer segmentation in Python's Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn & Ski-kitLearn. There are 2 x Python scripts, one for the data profiling, analysis, and visualisation, and the other for Customer Segmentation using unsupervised machine learning. There is also a demonstration PPT presentation. Some of the Matplotlib charts are reproduced below.
